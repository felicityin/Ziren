//! Per-shard device-trace provider trait.
//!
//! Explicit per-shard parameter replaces a process-global snapshot
//! slot: under multi-GPU compress, pool workers prove shards
//! concurrently and would race for the global, with the
//! `(height, width)` check unable to disambiguate same-shape chips
//! across shards — silent cryptographic corruption.
//!
//! Trait is erased over the device-handle type so `zkm-pcs` stays
//! CUDA-agnostic; concrete impls live in `ziren-gpu`.
